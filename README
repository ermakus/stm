Safari Torrent Manager
======================

Safari Torrent Manager (STM) is plugin for mobile safari that allow to download torrent files on Apple devices (iPhone/iPad/etc)
You can find it in Cydia with name "Torrent Downloader Safari Plugin"

Build
=====

I've develop this plugin on Linux with iOS toolchain (see http://code.google.com/p/iphonedevonlinux/wiki/Installation).
To build STM you also need installed cmake and libcurl

    $ cmake .
    $ make


Deploy to repository
====================

I am use Google App Engine to host cydia repository (look at 'site' folder). To create your own, you need to:

1. Change application id in site/app.yaml

2. Run make to prepare .deb package:

    $ make install

3. Go to 'site' folder and upload .deb to app engine:

    $ appcfg.py update
